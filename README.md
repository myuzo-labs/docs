***Myuzo Labs exists to liberate musical creativity, dismantling barriers through open-source collaboration, advanced audio separation, and artist-driven AI built around the exploration of sound.***

## High-Level Roadmap

* **Web-based Collaborative DAW Environment:**  Seamlessly create music together in real-time, regardless of location.
* **Advanced Audio Separation:** Isolate individual instrument layers, and even their component sounds, for unprecedented sonic control.
* **AI as Your Creative Collaborator:** Tools that spark inspiration, suggest new directions, and help you explore the sonic possibilities within your work. 
* **Community-Driven Innovation:** A space where ideas flow, and experimentation is celebrated.
* **Seamless Workflow Integration:** Switch effortlessly to your favorite DAW for in-depth editing, or make quick changes directly within the web app. 

## Why We Do This

We believe music is meant to be fluid and ever-evolving.  Our tools are designed to unlock the music we all hear in our heads, empowering artists of all skill levels to break free from creative limitations, and forge a future where collaboration is the heartbeat of musical expression.
